# Clarification about Code Assignment about The Perception Lesson in Search and Sample Return

This README file provides an overview of the code used in the perception step of the robotics project. It gives an introduction to the purpose of the code, explains the steps involved in reading and analyzing the image, and outlines the color thresholding process. For the actual code implementation, refer to the Jupyter Notebook associated with this assignment.

This code is part of the assignment for the Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree program, specifically for the module "The Perception Step" in the "Introduction to Robotics" lesson of the "Search and Sample Return" topic.

## Reading in Color Images

The first step in the perception process is to read in the images captured by the rover camera. These images, with a size of 320x160 pixels, will be used to determine the drivable areas in the environment. In this simplified case, the task is to identify the areas with lighter colors, which correspond to the sandy ground. The `matplotlib` library is used to read and plot the image.

## Understanding the Image

After reading the image, it is stored as an array, enabling various operations on it. The size, datatype, and minimum/maximum values of the array can be explored using the `numpy` package. In this case, the image is an 8-bit unsigned integer array (uint8) with a size of (160, 320, 3). The three dimensions represent the height, width, and color channels of the image.

## Isolating Color Channels

The image consists of three color channels: red, green, and blue (RGB). By zeroing out the other color channels, each channel can be observed individually. This process involves creating copies of the original image and setting the unwanted color channels to zero. The resulting images are then displayed side by side using `matplotlib`.

## Color Thresholding

To identify the drivable areas, a color thresholding function needs to be implemented. The function takes a color image and a 3-tuple of color threshold values (ranging from 0 to 255) as input and outputs a binary image with values of 0 or 1. Pixels above the threshold are assigned a value of 1, while those below the threshold are assigned a value of 0. The implementation of this function is left as an exercise.

Please note that the actual code implementation is not included in this README.md file. Refer to the associated Jupyter Notebook for the complete code.
