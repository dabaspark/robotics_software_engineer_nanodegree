# Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree

This repository contains my work for the Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree program offered by Udacity. It includes all the projects, exercises, and assignments completed throughout the duration of the program.

## Program Overview

The Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree program provides a comprehensive curriculum designed to develop the skills and knowledge required to work as a robotics software engineer. The program covers key topics in robotics, including perception, localization, path planning, control, and more. It includes both theoretical concepts and hands-on implementation using popular robotics frameworks and tools.

## Projects

The `projects` folder includes all the project submissions completed as part of the Nanodegree program. Each project is contained in a separate folder within the `projects` directory and includes the necessary code, documentation, and any additional resources related to that project.

This folder includes the following projects completed as part of the Nanodegree program:

1. Project 1: Introduction to Robotics
2. Project 2: Perception for Robotics
3. Project 3: Localization
4. Project 4: Mapping and SLAM
5. Project 5: Path Planning
6. Project 6: Control
7. Project 7: Robotic Arm

## Assignments

The `assignments` folder includes assignments completed during the Nanodegree program. These assignments are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures and provide hands-on practice. Each assignment is contained in a separate folder within the `assignments` directory and includes the necessary code and instructions.

## Programming Practices

The `programming_practices` folder includes additional programming exercises and practice problems completed as part of the Nanodegree program. These exercises provide opportunities to further develop programming skills in the context of robotics. Each practice is contained in a separate folder within the `programming_practices` directory and includes the necessary code and any related instructions.


Each project is contained in a separate folder within this repository and includes the necessary code, documentation, and any additional resources related to that project.

## Getting Started

To get started with any project, assignment, or programming practice, navigate to the respective folder. Each folder contains the necessary code, instructions, and any dependencies required to run the code.

If a specific folder doesn't have a separate README file, you can follow these general steps to get started:

1. Open the folder for the desired project, assignment, or programming practice.
2. Read any instructions or documentation provided within the folder.
3. Install any necessary dependencies or libraries mentioned in the instructions.
4. Run the code using the specified commands or scripts.
5. Modify and experiment with the code as desired.

Please note that some projects, assignments, or programming practices may have their own dedicated README files. In such cases, it is recommended to refer to the specific README file for detailed instructions and guidelines.

Remember to refer to the Nanodegree program materials, lectures, and other resources provided by Udacity for additional context and guidance on the topics covered in each project, assignment, or programming practice.
